# book-search-engine

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This application is designed so users can search for books that they are interested and save them so they can look at them at later time. This will aid the user in deciding whether they should purchase or rent the books that they were looking into. Through this project I was able to gain a better understanding of MERN.
